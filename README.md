2-player real time fast chess game by assembly x86 and serial communication

## Description
This is our project for Microprocessor course in 2nd year of collage. In the game, each piece moves exactly like standard chess.
The main difference is that there are no turns, which means one player can move multiple pieces while 
the other player didn't move any pieces but there is a countdown of 3 sec <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/470/470153.png" width="30" height="30" /> for each piece to be moved again which is displayed by a small red square in the upper right corner of each piece.
To win this game you have to captrue your opponent's king <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/707/707112.png" width="30" height="20" />.
